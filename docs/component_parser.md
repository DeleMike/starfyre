# Component Parser in Starfyre

### Introduction
This document provides an overview of the `ComponentParser` in Starfyre. This crucial feature ensures the correct parsing of PyML structure, validates tags, and maintains proper tag order in Starfyre components.

### Feature Overview
The `ComponentParser` is responsible for parsing PyML structures and ensuring that they adhere to specified rules. It plays a significant role in validating tags, their attributes, and their order within the component.

## Exception Handling

### UnknownTagError
As part of this improvement, an `UnknownTagError` exception class has been introduced. This exception is raised when an unknown tag is encountered during parsing. It helps identify which component had the unknown tag, making debugging and troubleshooting easier.

### Implementation Details
The `ComponentParser` in Starfyre is implemented as a class inheriting the `HTMLParser`. Here's an overview of its functionality:
```python
class ComponentParser(HTMLParser):
    # Constructor and attributes details...

    def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs):
        # Logic for handling start tags...

    def handle_endtag(self, tag):
        # Logic for handling end tags...

    def handle_data(self, data):
        # Logic for handling data...

    # Additional methods for processing PyML content...

```
### Event Handling and Props
The parser identifies event handlers and props within PyML tags, ensuring they are correctly associated with their respective components.

### Custom Components
When encountering custom components in PyML, the parser correctly integrates them into the component hierarchy. This ensures that custom components are properly recognized and processed.

### Error Handling
The Component Parser performs thorough error checking, ensuring that tags are valid and in the correct order. When an issue is detected, it raises an exception with detailed information, including the component name and line number.

### Usage Example
Here's an example of how the Component Parser is utilized within Starfyre:

1) Create a PyML file for your Starfyre component.

2) Define your component structure using PyML syntax.

3) Use the RootParser class to parse the PyML content of your component.

4) Handle any exceptions raised during parsing, including the UnknownTagError.

5) Utilize the parsed component structure to generate dynamic content within your Starfyre application.

### Conclusion
The Component Parser is a critical part of Starfyre, ensuring the correct parsing and validation of PyML structures. With the introduction of the UnknownTagError and improved error reporting, developers can more easily identify and resolve issues within their components.
